1.Breast Cancer Prediction:-    
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast
cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging
historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for
assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
Using Built-in SKLearn Datasets
2.Speech Emotion Recognition:-
The objective of this project is to develop a robust speech emotion recognition system capable
of accurately classifying the emotional states conveyed in spoken language. By analyzing the
acoustic features of speech signals, the system should be able to categorize emotions such as
happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more.
